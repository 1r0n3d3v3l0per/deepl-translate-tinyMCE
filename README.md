TinyMCE Toolbar with Deepl and OpenAI

I am pleased to announce that I have migrated the ScribeFlow-MCE repository to a new link! You can find the updated repository at the following address: https://github.com/1r0n3d3v3l0per/scribeflow-mce.

The repository migration brings several advantages, including improved code organization, more efficient version management, and a stronger collaborative environment. Furthermore, the new repository link reflects my ongoing commitment to the development and updates of ScribeFlow-MCE.

I invite all developers, writing enthusiasts, and those interested in exploring new translation and text generation features to visit the new repository. You can delve into the source code, contribute ideas and suggestions, and be part of the growth of this exciting project.

I would like to thank everyone who has followed and supported the repository thus far, and I hope that this migration will lead to an even better experience for all users of ScribeFlow-MCE.
